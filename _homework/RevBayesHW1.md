## RevBayes Homework One

1. In Fig. 2, what would each of these distributions say about the skill of the archer? 

2. In Fig. 3, why is the number of observations constant?

3. In the slide move, try 5 different ranges for the slide move. Which one produces the best ESS? 

4. In the slide move, try 5 different ranges for the scale move. Which one produces the best ESS? 

5. How does using both moves change the ESS? Why does this make (or not make) sense? 

6. What happens if we change to an uniformative Gamma(0.001, 0.001)?
