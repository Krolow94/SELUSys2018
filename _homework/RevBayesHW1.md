## RevBayes Homework One

1. In Fig. 2, what would each of these distributions say about the skill of the archer? 

The higher the value the better the archers ability to hit the target

2. In Fig. 3, why is the number of observations constant?

To standardize the comparison since mu is derived from the distribution of the arrows 
shot. So if you use one archer that shoots one arrow dead bullseye vs another archer that 
shoots 10 and hits only 1 then you cannot standardize your assumptions due to a lack of 
data. 

3. If you were not able to, finish the compilation of RevBayes. Copy the executeable (called rb) into your work directory.
