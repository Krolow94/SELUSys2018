## PAUP and Parsimony Lab

1. From the iterative alignment section: Which aslignment (pasta_script1, pasta_script2, pasta_script3) do you think is the "best"? By what criteria did you arrive at this decision? 

In my opinnion script 2 had the best alignment due to the higher number of homologies present after an intial 
run of assesments. 

2. In tree searching, when would you expect the swap algorithm to matter strongly?

Certainly when using the moving around larger parts of the tree like the tree bisection & subtree pruning. These 
types of huersitic shortcuts would matter when looking at a taxanomic group that has several unresolved lineages 
or when there large gaps in the sequences used for your analysis. 

3. In your own words, what is a bootstrap analysis? Does it make sense to describe a bootstrap value as the probability that a grouping on a tree is correct?

Bootstrap determines how robust your analysis is. It does not make sense to describe a bootstrap value as a probability because confidence is a human construct that has grades but not necessarily defined values for it

4. What might be a situation in which you would want to use the jackknife instead of the bootstrap? 

Whenever you have a huge data set (all clupidae) that makes it difficult to get a confidence reading for the entire data set.

5. Transfer your trees to your desktop. Use FigTree or IcyTree to view them. Take a screenshot, and save it to the fig folder in the class repository. Below, complete the file path to where you have the file in the fig directory to embed the image of your screen shot.
